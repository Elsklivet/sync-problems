# Synchronization Problems

In my CS1550 class at the University of Pittsburgh, a big topic was solving synchronization problems using semaphores, locks, condition variables, etc. It is actually pretty neat stuff, and my awesome professor (thanks Dr. Khattab!) suggested the *Little Book of Semaphores* by Allen B. Downey. That book has a lot of concurrency problems to solve in it, so I decided to take a crack at some of them using different languages for practice, and I store those all here.

Here's a [link to the book](https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/) in case you wanna take a crack at them too ðŸ˜‰. As of writing, it's available as a PDF for free from the publisher.
